Waheed Anwar

I am a full stack web developer from Bahawalpur Pakistan. I am assistant professor at IUB. I started writing code about 19 years ago. I started with Java and then moved to web technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and PHP. I have worked for companies as well as ran my own. I love helping students learn to code and better their lives.
